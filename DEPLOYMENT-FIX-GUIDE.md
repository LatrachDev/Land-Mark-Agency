# Deployment Fix Guide for LandMark Agency

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Asset Path Problems
- **Problem**: Assets were referenced with `/src/assets/` paths which don't exist in production
- **Solution**: All assets now use proper ES6 imports and get processed by Vite

### 2. Service Worker Cache Issues
- **Problem**: Service worker was trying to cache non-existent asset paths
- **Solution**: Updated service worker to handle dynamic asset caching

### 3. File Name Mismatch
- **Problem**: Code referenced `Web-Site-bg-black.jpg` but file was named `Web-Site-BG-black.jpg`
- **Solution**: Fixed all imports to use correct filename

## Files Modified

1. **public/sw.js** - Updated service worker for better asset caching
2. **src/components/PerformanceOptimizer.jsx** - Fixed asset imports
3. **src/pages/Home.jsx** - Fixed logo reference in structured data
4. **src/pages/Blog.jsx** - Fixed logo reference
5. **src/components/SEOHead.jsx** - Fixed default logo path
6. **src/config/seoConfig.js** - Fixed default image path
7. **src/hooks/useMobilePerformance.js** - Removed problematic font preloading
8. **vite.config.js** - Improved build configuration
9. **public/.htaccess** - Added for Apache hosting (if applicable)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Upload Files
Upload the entire `dist` folder contents to your web hosting root directory.

### 3. Server Configuration

#### For Apache (if using .htaccess)
The `.htaccess` file is already included in the build.

#### For Nginx
Add this to your Nginx config:
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}

location /assets {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

### 4. Test the Deployment
1. Check that all images load properly
2. Verify that the service worker registers without errors
3. Test mobile performance

## Key Changes Made

1. **Asset Imports**: All assets now use proper ES6 imports instead of hardcoded paths
2. **Service Worker**: Now handles dynamic asset caching instead of trying to preload specific paths
3. **Build Configuration**: Optimized for production with proper asset handling
4. **Cache Headers**: Added proper caching for static assets

## Mobile Performance
The mobile styling issues should now be resolved because:
1. Assets have proper paths and will load correctly
2. Service worker no longer fails on asset caching
3. Font loading is optimized for mobile devices

## Notes
- All asset URLs are now dynamically generated during build
- The service worker will cache assets as they're loaded
- Build process creates optimized, hashed asset names for better caching
